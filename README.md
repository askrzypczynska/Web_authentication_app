The site contains three sub-pages: 
- the first page "Rejestracja" allows you to create an account
- the second page "Logowanie" allows you to log in to a previously created account
- the third page "Główna strona" shows you the home page where your name is displayed if you are logged in.

### Technologies Used
* React.js
* HTML
* CSS

### Getting Started
Install in the project directory npm:

```
npm install
```

Now you can in the project directory run:
```
npm start
```
Runs the app in the development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser.

AND!

Start your server with the node command followed by the name of the JavaScript file.
```
node server.js
```

### Other npm options

```
npm test
```
Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.
See the section about running tests for more information.
```
npm run build
```
Builds the app for production to the build folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about deployment for more information.
```
npm run eject
```
#### Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you can't go back!

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can eject at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except eject will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use eject. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
